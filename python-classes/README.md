## Learning Objectives
- Why python programmming is awesome
- What is OOP
- "first-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class an object or an instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protectd and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributed to object and classes
- What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
- How does python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the getattr function

## Requirements
- All requirements from base repo
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Descriptions of Tasks
- [0-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/0-square.py) - Make an empty class called Square
- [1-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/1-square.py) - A class based on task 0 with private instance attribute size
- [2-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/2-square.py) - A class based on task 1 thatraises different exceptions based on size
- [3-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/3-square.py) - A class based on task 2 with a public instance method that returns the current area of the square
- [4-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/4-square.py) - A class based on task 3 with a getter and setter method for size
- [5-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/5-square.py) - A class based on task 4 with a public instance method that prints in stdout the square with the character #
- [6-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/6-square.py) - A class based on task 5 with a private instance attribute position as well as a getter and setter method for position of the square
- [100-singly_linked_list.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/100-singly_linked_list.py) - A class that defines a singly linked list
- [101-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/101-square.py) - A class based on task 6 that shows the same behaviour as my_print() when the Square instance is printed
- [102-square.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/102-square.py) - A class based on task 4-square that can answer to comparators: ==, !=, >, >=, < and <= based on the area of the squares
- [103-magic_class.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-classes/103-magic_class.py) - A MagicClass class that does some magic calculation that keeps coming back over and over again like whats the point even of this magic calculation man. It is what it is.
