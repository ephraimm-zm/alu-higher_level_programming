## Learning Objectives

- The objective of this project are the same as the objectives for [python](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/tree/main/python-classes#learning-objectives)
- The objective therefore is to strengthen the objectives from that project

## Description Of Tasks

- [0-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/0-rectangle.py) - An empty class that defines a rectangle.
- [1-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/2-rectangle.py) - The class from task 0 but with private instance attributes for width and height with getter and setter methods.
- [2-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/2-rectangle.py) - The class from task 1 but with public instance methods for calculating area and perimeter of the rectangle.
- [3-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/3-rectangle.py) - The class from task 2 that prints the rectangle with the character "#" when print() and str() are called.
- [4-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/4-rectangle.py) - The class from task 3 that returns a string representation of the rectangle when repr() is called. The representation should be able to recreate a new instance when eval() is called.
- [5-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/5-rectangle.py) - The class from task 4 that prints a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.
- [6-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/6-rectangle.py) - The class from task 5 that keeps track of the number of instances of Rectangle.
- [7-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/7-rectangle.py) - The class from task 6 with a public class attribute "print_symbol" initialized to #. In this case, print() and str() should print the rectangle with the character stored in print_symbol
- [8-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/8-rectangle.py) - The class from task 7, but with a static method that returns the rectangle with a larger area from two given rectangles.
- [9-rectangle.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/9-rectangle.py) - The class from task 8, but with a class method, square, to return a square rectangle with equal width and height...
- [101-nqueens.py](https://github.com/ephraimm-zm/alu-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-more_classes/101-nqueens.py) - What seems like a backtracking question that I dont understand at the moment but I'll be back to update this section once the understand is understanding.
